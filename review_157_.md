### Interest of Content
Wide range of topics covered :)

### Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
Most of the files have a consistent and high quality visual presentation.

Only 'Communication.html' has a link back to index, the others are all standalone
'onlinebanking.html' has no formatting, and thus a completely different style to the rest of the website

### Quality of Written Presentation
'onlinebanking.html' is a bit messy but the rest is solid.

### Validity of HTML
Overall, just a few minor errors on most pages.

The most common problem being the replace elements in the header don't need trailing slashes.

It should be noted, indentation is poor and makes it hard to keep track of tag pairs.

#### index.html
Everything is good here :D.

#### Communication.html
Minor errors, but nothing dangerous
1) Document should include a lang = "en" to the html start tag
2) The replace elements (lines 5, 6, 8 and 9) don't need trailing slashes

#### LTS.html
Just the same trailing slash error on lines 4,5,7 and 8 as Communication.html

#### WFC.html
On lines 31 and 42 we have main elements inside of a main elements.

A document should only have one main element

The main elements on lines 18, 31, and 47 as well as the div elements on lines 19, 32, and 48 are not closed.

Interestingly, on line 42 there is a closing </p> tag, but no opening <p> tag.

#### onlinebanking.html
Line 11 has a minor mispelling of height in the img tag, and on line 17 there is an unclosed dl tag.

Outside this, there are a few repeated mistakes:
1) Lines [19,29,39], h3 cannot be a descendant of the dt element
2) Line [25,33,35,43,45,47,48], img cannot be a child of ul
