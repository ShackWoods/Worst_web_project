            <p class="card-text">
                In July 1949, before the Advent of the Computer, weather forecasts consisted of hand-drawn weather charts of pressure accompanied by a script written by the Met office. This could only accurately predict weather in the short term however. These older systems, although workable, were not able to account for all the complexities within weather, disallowing swift prediction as well as prediction for the Climate plenty of years into the future, which were only made possible due to more High Processing Computers.

                        <li class = "list-group-item"><strong>Modelling: </strong>There are two types of Weather Forecasting, Weather which spans a shorter time - around 2 hours up to 2 weeks ahead. Where Seasonal Weather lasts for up to a year ahead and Climate Forecasts runs 10s of years ahead. These models divide the region from surface to top of atmosphere into a 3D Grid. Billions of points inside these grids initialises the model with data such as temperature, pressure, humidity and wind observations. The model then uses mathematical equations to represent the physical processes governing the behaviour of the atmosphere changing with time. </li>
                        <li class = "list-group-item"><strong>Data Assimilation: </strong>Weather Forecasting relies on the assimilation of Real-Time data into Numerical models. Computers collect data from satellites and weather stations and combine them with historical observations. This process, known as data assimilation helps refine the initial conditions for Weather Models which improves the accuracy of short term weather forecasts. Parametrisation is a way to replace and supplement physical processes that are too small to scale with the model, represented as models within the model, allowing a more accurate range of factors to be taken into account </li>

                        Each step of Weather Forecasting is incredibly computationally intensive, and would take thousands of both people and time to get done. Supercomputers use immense processing power to enable meteorologists to tackle these complex computations efficiently. High-performance computing facilities allow for faster model simulations and increased resolution. This results in faster and more accurate predictions. This also means you can predict farther into the future, keeping records that can keep places safe from Flash Floods etc. for years to come
