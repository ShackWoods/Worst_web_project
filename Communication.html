    In essence, instant messaging is the technology that allows us to communicate real-time. It enables us to contact people almost anywhere in the world, at any time.

    Historically, one would have to write a letter and it could take months to reach its destination. Now, at the click of a button, we can send messages, images and videos 
    instantly. This has become vital in our day to day lives.

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        Instant messaging is a massive aide in all industries. One example is <b>healthcare</b>. It has become so much easier to address the concerns of people all around the 
        world through instant messages. A quick message to the gp describing your ailments allows it to be addressed much sooner than joining a 6 month waiting list.
        Another major example is <b>>emergency response</b>. When there is an emergency, it's crucial that people are made aware as quickly as possible. Even a matter 
        of minutes can save hundreds more lives. It also allows live updates. For example, there's a fire and people are being evacuated by the front of the building. 
        However, the fire has now spread to that area. Instantly notifying the people of this change allows them to change route before the fire spreads further,
        blocking off any remaining escape routes.
